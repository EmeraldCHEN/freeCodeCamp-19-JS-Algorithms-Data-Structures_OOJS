Object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS): 
Inheritance for reusing code & Encapsulation for creating objects with specialized functionalities.

A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared, which is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.

The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. 

IIFE is often used to group related functionality into a single object or module.
